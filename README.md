# Opensteno
A free and open steno software for GNU/Linux. It will change the keyboard behaviour so that instead of pushing keys
in sequence to produce a word letter by letter you hold down multiple keys at once to produce whole words and sentences.

Compile with
```cmake ./; make; make run;```

To exit opensteno you have to stroke KWR.
